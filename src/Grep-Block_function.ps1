.SYNOPSIS
    Grep-Block (Alias: blgrep) - Grep the list while preserving parent-child relationship

    Searches the list and returns the list block by treating a line with:
    
        - a non-blank character at the beginning as a title, and
        - a line with a blank character at the beginning as a body

    Usage:
        cat list.txt | Grep-Block <regex>

    Params:
         [-c|-CaseSensitive]
         [-s|-SimpleMatch]
         [-v|-NotMatch]
         [-t|-OnlyTitle] ...Output only blocks with matching title
         [-SkipBlank]
         
         [[-f|-File] <String>]
         [[-Delimiter] <String>]
