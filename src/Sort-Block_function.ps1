.SYNOPSIS
    Sort-Block (Alias: blsort) - Sort based on the title line without destroying the body of the list

    Sort the list and returns the list block by treating a line with:
    
        - a non-blank character at the beginning as a title, and
        - a line with a blank character at the beginning as a body

    Usage:
        cat list.txt | Sort-Block
    
    Params:
         [-d|-Descending]
         [-c|-CaseSensitive]
         [-u|-Unique]
         [-s|-Stable]
         [-o|-Ordinal]
         [-SkipBlank]
         
         [[-f|-File] <String>]
         [[-Delimiter] <String>]
